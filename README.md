# real-time-pwa (BirdNET Live)

**BirdNET Live** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that brings the power of the BirdNET acoustic identification algorithm directly to your web browser. It allows you to identify bird species from their sounds in real-time using your device's microphone (requires microphone permission).

Key features:
*   **Run offline**: All processing happens locally on your device using TensorFlow.js. No audio data is ever uploaded to a server (models and assets are downloaded once and stored locally).
*   **Real-Time Identification**: Visualizes sound via a spectrogram and provides instant species predictions.
*   **Location-Aware**: Uses your device's geolocation (optional) to filter predictions for species likely to be found in your area.
*   **Offline Capable**: Once loaded, the app works without an internet connection.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Runs on desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).

⚠️ **Note**: This project is still in active development. Features and performance may vary across devices and browsers.

## Usage

You can access the live version of this project at: [https://birdnet-team.github.io/real-time-pwa/](https://birdnet-team.github.io/real-time-pwa/)

To install the PWA on your device, open the site in a compatible browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and follow the prompts to add it to your home screen or desktop (choose "Install App" when prompted).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/birdnet-team/real-time-pwa.git
   cd real-time-pwa
   ```

2. Build and run the site locally:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run serve
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the site.

For deployments hosted under a custom subpath, set `ELEVENTY_PATH_PREFIX` when building (for example, `ELEVENTY_PATH_PREFIX=/birdnet-live-analyzer/ npm run build`). The default remains `/real-time-pwa/` for GitHub Pages.
